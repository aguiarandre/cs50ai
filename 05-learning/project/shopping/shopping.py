    Load shopping data from a CSV file `filename` and convert into a list of
    evidence lists and a list of labels. Return a tuple (evidence, labels).

    evidence should be a list of lists, where each list contains the
    following values, in order:
        - Administrative, an integer
        - Administrative_Duration, a floating point number
        - Informational, an integer
        - Informational_Duration, a floating point number
        - ProductRelated, an integer
        - ProductRelated_Duration, a floating point number
        - BounceRates, a floating point number
        - ExitRates, a floating point number
        - PageValues, a floating point number
        - SpecialDay, a floating point number
        - Month, an index from 0 (January) to 11 (December)
        - OperatingSystems, an integer
        - Browser, an integer
        - Region, an integer
        - TrafficType, an integer
        - VisitorType, an integer 0 (not returning) or 1 (returning)
        - Weekend, an integer 0 (if false) or 1 (if true)

    labels should be the corresponding list of labels, where each label
    is 1 if Revenue is true, and 0 otherwise.

    Added notes:
        This process is likely to not work in real life production model. 
        And it may be even potentially dangerous. 
        
        Production rationale: As this is a simple case, it is fine, but 
        if in real life something changes, we are not considering it. For example,
        the treatment we had to perfom on the variable 'June' to translate it to 'Jun', 
        if any new incoming data does not follow that rule, or if sometime 'Jul' comes as 
        'July', we would end up with a crash. The best solution would be to include 
        these transformations in a pipeline that would better handle possible errors.
        Best idea would be to fit these transforms in the training set and apply them
        on the testing set/real world incoming data.

        Dangerous  rationale: We should have created our variables only after 
        splitting our dataset. In this case it is acceptable, but if we were 
        to input missing values using an average, for instance, we would have 
        leaked data from our training set to our test set. We would end up with 
        a probable over-estimated test score as compared to real life production 
        model.
